	To understand this, you have to understand the term "hoisting".

	Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations 
	to the top of the current scope 
	(to the top of the current script or the current function).

		The let and const Keywords
		Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

		Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.

		Using a let or const variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.

		The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared:
		
		ES2015 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

		These two keywords provide Block Scope variables (and constants) in JavaScript.

		Before ES2015, JavaScript had only two types of scope: Global Scope and Function Scope. 
		
		Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.
		
		Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
		
		JavaScript Block Scope
		Variables declared with the var keyword cannot have Block Scope.

		Variables declared inside a block {} can be accessed from outside the block.
		
		Before ES2015 JavaScript did not have Block Scope.

		Variables declared with the let keyword can have Block Scope.

		Variables declared inside a block {} cannot be accessed from outside the block:
