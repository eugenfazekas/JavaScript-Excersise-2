	Hoisting
	Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time (if you don't know what Hoisting is, read our Hoisting Chapter).

	Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared:
	
	Variables defined with const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

	Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.

	Using a const variable before it is declared will result in a SyntaxError.

	The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared:
